  Doctor's notes
  ⚠ Context tax: 6 sessions ran past 100 turns — late turns re-read ~109k cached
    tokens apiece vs ~29k early, ≈ $84 of pure re-reading. Context is rent,
    not a purchase: /compact or restart between tasks.
  ⚠ Re-read tax: 351 repeat file reads inside sessions (~1.5MB re-entering
    context) — main.py alone was read 85× in one session.
  · All 32 compactions were auto-forced at the context ceiling — each shed ~155k
    tokens you'd been re-paying every turn.
  · 44% of spend is command-running turns. Verbose build/test output is
    token-hungry — pipe through tail/grep, silence noisy commands.
  ✓ Healthy cache: 99% of input was served from cache, saving $851 vs list price.
  ✓ Lean tool results: ~1.5KB per tool turn on average.
```

## The problem

Every developer now has an AI usage limit — and no instrument panel. Your agents already log everything (every token, tool call, and model) into local JSONL files nobody reads. vibecheck reads them and answers:

- **Am I going to blow my monthly limit?** — `--budget` burn-down with projection to month end
- **What activities eat my tokens?** — editing vs. executing vs. exploring vs. reasoning, per turn
- **What did that branch cost?** — spend by branch, project, model, agent, and day
- **What is caching saving me?** — vs. API list price (often 5× the headline spend)

One normalized report across Claude Code and Codex. More agents coming.

## Privacy

**Everything runs locally. Nothing leaves your machine.** No telemetry, no accounts, no uploads. It's a read-only parser over files you already have. Prompt and code content is never parsed — only token counts, models, tool names, and timestamps.

## Install

```bash
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check        # zero-install — if you run Claude Code, you already have Node
```

Or install globally for the short command:

```bash
npm install -g @realkenlee/vibe-check   # then just: vibecheck
```

No Node? Locked-down laptop? Grab a **single-file executable** from
[Releases](../../releases) (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64, Windows) — no runtime,
no dependencies, one artifact to checksum and allowlist.

### No install at all — as a Claude Code skill

You already have an agent that can read the logs. Install vibecheck as a [skill](skill/SKILL.md):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/vibecheck && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realkenlee/vibecheck/main/skill/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/vibecheck/SKILL.md
```

Then ask Claude Code *"where do my AI tokens go?"* (or run `/vibecheck`). The skill encodes the
same parsing rules this CLI is tested against — message-id dedupe, cache-subset splits, list
prices — and instructs Claude to compute via a throwaway script, never by reading your logs
into context. Same privacy contract: everything stays local.

## Usage

```bash
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check                   # full report, all time
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --days 30         # last 30 days
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --month 2026-05   # one calendar month (reconciliation)
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --project api     # scope everything to one project (any substring)
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --branch q2-migration   # …or to one git branch — what did it cost?
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --agent codex     # one agent only: claude-code | codex
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check months            # month-over-month spend + agent runtime trend with Δ%
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --budget 200      # monthly soft limit → burn-down + projection
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check doctor            # just the diagnosis — doctor's notes only
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check doctor --fail-on-warn   # exit 1 on any ⚠ note — CI hygiene gate
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check sessions          # most expensive sessions, span + turns
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check sessions <id>     # drill in: gaps, compactions, activity split
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check wrapped --out wrapped.svg   # shareable card (aggregates only)
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check wrapped --month 2026-06 --out june.svg   # "AI Coding Wrapped · June 2026"
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check web               # static HTML dashboard — no server, opens in browser
npx @realkenlee/vibe-check --json            # machine-readable, pipe it anywhere
```

Set `VIBECHECK_BUDGET=200` to make the budget bar permanent.

`wrapped` renders a 1200×630 card built to be posted — aggregate numbers only, never project or branch names (sample below uses synthetic data):

<img src="docs/wrapped-sample.svg" alt="AI Coding Wrapped sample card (synthetic data)" width="600">


Or as a library:

```ts
import { parseClaudeDir, totals, byActivity, budgetStatus } from '@realkenlee/vibe-check'

const { events } = parseClaudeDir(`${process.env.HOME}/.claude/projects`)
console.log(byActivity(events))
```

## For teams & enterprise

ICs get visibility for free. Engineering leaders get the questions ICs can't answer alone: *is our AI spend producing edits or spinning on retries? Which teams are over their soft limits? What did the migration actually cost?*

The bridge is `vibecheck export` — an **aggregates-only** JSON report each developer can inspect line-by-line before sharing:

```bash
vibecheck export --days 30 --out report.json   # totals, activities, models, daily spend
vibecheck export --anonymous                   # …without your git name/email
vibecheck export --include-projects            # opt-in: project + branch names
```

By default the export contains **no prompts, no code, no file paths, no session ids, no project or branch names** — read [`src/export.ts`](src/export.ts), it's one screen of code. The full schema is documented in [`docs/report-schema.md`](docs/report-schema.md) (additive-only within v1; a test keeps doc and code in sync). Doctor's notes travel as **stable ids + levels only** (never the rendered text); the id vocabulary is documented in [`docs/doctor-notes.md`](docs/doctor-notes.md).

**vibecheck for Teams** (hosted rollups, org-wide burn-down, activity benchmarks, gateway-level capture) is in design. Interested? → khflee@gmail.com

## Supported agents

| Agent | Data source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | ✅ |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | ✅ |
| Gemini CLI | — | planned |
| Cursor | — | planned |
| opencode | — | planned |

## Accuracy notes

- Costs are **API list-price estimates** (per-MTok rates in [`src/pricing.ts`](src/pricing.ts)). Subscription users: read it as "value consumed," not "money billed."
- Claude Code streams duplicate assistant records — vibecheck dedupes by message id (naive parsers over-count by ~30%).
- Codex `cached_input_tokens` is a subset of `input_tokens` — vibecheck splits it out before pricing.
- Activity attribution is per-turn by dominant tool (precedence: editing > executing > delegating > exploring > planning). Read it as "cost of turns spent doing X."
- Unparseable lines are counted and surfaced — these JSONL schemas are undocumented and drift between agent versions. If you see the schema-drift warning, please [file a drift report](../../issues/new?template=schema-drift.yml) — it asks for counts and key names only, never your transcripts.

## Development

Parsers are the product, so everything is fixture-tested:

```bash
npm install
npm test        # 112 tests over synthetic fixtures encoding every schema gotcha
npm run dev     # build + run against your own sessions
```

CI runs on linux/macos/windows across Node 18/20/22. Every release also executes the Windows `.exe` on a real Windows runner before it ships.

## Roadmap

- [x] Activity attribution ("where tokens go")
- [x] Budget burn-down with month-end projection
- [x] Branch-level cost attribution (`--branch`, `--project`, `--agent` filters)
- [x] Month-over-month spend trend (`vibecheck months`, Δ%)
- [x] Aggregates-only team export (`vibecheck export`, `vibecheck.report.v1` schema)
- [x] Session drill-down (`vibecheck sessions`, per-session detail via `sessions <id>`)
- [x] Doctor's notes (actionable diagnosis: cache health, context tax, idle gaps, compaction receipts, re-read tax, failure tax, verbosity drift)
- [x] Agent runtime from `turn_duration` records — how long the agent actually worked, not wall-clock; cost per agent-hour; monthly runtime trend
- [x] "AI Coding Wrapped" shareable card (`vibecheck wrapped`, SVG, aggregates only)
- [x] Local dashboard (`vibecheck web` — single static HTML file, no server, no JS)
- [ ] Gemini CLI, Cursor, opencode parsers
- [ ] vibecheck for Teams (hosted)
